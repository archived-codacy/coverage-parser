Scala library for parsing coverage reports.

The parsers in this project receive as input two parameters, the project root folder, and the coverage report file.
As a result of the parse operation, it will produce either a CoverageReport, a class that is compatible with the
[Codacy coverage format](https://support.codacy.com/hc/en-us/articles/207279819-Coverage) or a string describing the
error parsing the coverage report file.

## Supported formats

Check the table for the formats we support and which coverage tools generate them:

| Language   | Coverage tools (examples) | Formats   |
| ---        | ---                       | ---       |
| Java       | [JaCoCo](http://eclemma.org/jacoco/) <br> [Cobertura](http://cobertura.github.io/cobertura/) | JaCoCo <br> Cobertura |
| Scala      | [sbt-jacoco](https://www.scala-sbt.org/sbt-jacoco/) <br> [scoverage](http://scoverage.org/) | JaCoCo <br> Cobertura |
| Javascript | [Istanbul](https://github.com/gotwarlost/istanbul) <br> [Poncho](https://github.com/deepsweet/poncho) <br> [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/) + [Blanket.js](https://github.com/alex-seville/blanket) | LCOV |
| Python     | [Coverage.py](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/coverage-5.0.3/) | Cobertura                 |
| PHP        | [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.readthedocs.io/en/8.5/code-coverage-analysis.html) | PHPUnit XML <br> [Clover](https://confluence.atlassian.com/clover/using-clover-for-php-420973033.html) |
| Ruby       | [SimpleCov](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov) | [Cobertura](https://github.com/dashingrocket/simplecov-cobertura) <br> [LCOV](https://github.com/fortissimo1997/simplecov-lcov) |
| C#         | [OpenCover](https://github.com/OpenCover/opencover) <br> [DotCover CLI](https://www.jetbrains.com/dotcover/) | OpenCover <br> DotCover-DetailedXML |

You can use this parser with any of the listed coverage formats, even if your language or coverage tool of choice is not in the table above.
If your coverage reports are in a different format you can use a format converter, such as
[ReportGenerator](https://danielpalme.github.io/ReportGenerator/), to generate a supported format.

Usage:

```
val reader: Either[String, CoverageReport] = CoverageParser.parse(rootProjectDir, coberturaFile)
```

## What is Codacy?

[Codacy](https://www.codacy.com/) is an Automated Code Review Tool that monitors your technical debt, helps you improve your code quality, teaches best practices to your developers, and helps you save time in Code Reviews.
