Scala library for parsing coverage reports.

The parsers in this project receive as input two parameters, the project root folder, and the coverage report file.
As a result of the parse operation, it will produce either a CoverageReport, a class that is compatible with the
[Codacy coverage format](https://support.codacy.com/hc/en-us/articles/207279819-Coverage) or a string describing the
error parsing the coverage report file.

## Supported formats

Check the formats we support [on the documentation](https://docs.codacy.com/coverage-reporter/adding-coverage-to-your-repository/). You can use this parser with any of the listed coverage formats, independently of your language or coverage tool of choice.

If your coverage reports are in a different format you can [use a format converter to generate a supported format](https://docs.codacy.com/coverage-reporter/troubleshooting-common-issues/#unsupported-report-formats).

Usage:

```
val reader: Either[String, CoverageReport] = CoverageParser.parse(rootProjectDir, coberturaFile)
```
